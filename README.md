# 🔍About
A community-driven app, developed independently, for implantable technologies and human augmentations.
ZINC is a slick environment to manage, study, and enjoy your bio-tech with games, alternate reality experiences, low-level hacking tools, and standardized tests.

We aim to support all commercial implants as well as to give you the freedom to include your own projects and hacks. 
In that mindset, the app is both very user-friendly superficially but also extremely open to mods and hacks by exposing a lot of data through saved files behind the scenes.
ZINC features implant tracking and management as well as modernized NFC tools specifically designed for biotech.
ZINC also includes many biomagnet features most of which work in tandem with the open-source LODESTONE haptic devices that can be made DIY or ordered online.

### Goals
 - To create a user-friendly platform and a sufficient audience to allow cool experiments in implant-based AR/VR, gaming, performance tests/comparison, and accessories.
 - To provide specific tools needed in the community but not available in mainstream apps.
 - To educate and promote curiosity.

# 🧲Lodestones and ZINC
Multiple biomagnet features on ZINC require a Lodestone. They are an open-source sister project that provides plug n' play tools for magnet implants. You can buy one or make one!
