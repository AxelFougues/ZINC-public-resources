A community-driven app, developed independently, for implantable technologies and human augmentations.
ZINC is a slick environment to manage, study and enjoy your bio-tech with games, alternate reality experiences, low-level tools, and standardized tests.

It features modernized NFC tools specifically designed for cyborgs.
ZINC also includes biomagnet features most of which work in tandem with the LODESTONE haptic devices that can be made DIY or ordered online.
